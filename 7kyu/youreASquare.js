// A square of squares
// You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

// However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

// Task
// Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

// In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

// The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

// Examples
// -1  =>  false
//  0  =>  true
//  3  =>  false
//  4  =>  true
// 25  =>  true
// 26  =>  false


////////////////

let isSquare = function(num){
    // SUCCESS
    let rootTest = Math.sqrt(num)%1
    if(rootTest < 0 || rootTest === NaN){
        return false
    } else if(rootTest === 0){
        return true
    }
    return false

    // with ternary ??
    // rootTest < 0 || rootTest === NaN ?
    // false :
    // rootTest === 0 ?
    // true : false


    // REFACTOR with Codewars Solution
    //ternary not needed can simply use comparison to return bool:
    // return Math.sqrt(num)%1 === 0


  }

// console.log(isSquare())
